| Metric      | LR Model | MNB Model|
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Accuracy    | 0.99    | 0.93    |
| Precision   | 0.99    | 0.93    |
| Recall      | 0.98    | 0.93    |
| F1 Score    | 0.99    | 0.93    |

This shows that Logistic Regression performs better than Multinomial Naive Bayes model in all the performance metrics
